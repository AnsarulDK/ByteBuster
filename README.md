# ByteBuster
This project is based on binary to decimal conversion. Here a user will be asked to try with his/her guess of decimal number in response of randomly-generated 
binary number. The user can come up with his/her guess for max 5 times. If his/her guess is correct for 3 times, he/she will be in the hitlist, will be saved in the 
file and will be shown for the next attempted user(who are in the hitlist). If he/she doesn't succeed to have 3 correct answeres he/she will be asked for his/her
intention of proceeding.
